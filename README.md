`bevior_tree` is behavior tree plugin for Bevy.

See `examples` directory.
The `chase.rs` example is written for your first step.
[Docs](https://docs.rs/bevior_tree/) are available, too.

If you want to know about specific node, unit tests in the code might help.

This crate started with reference to [`seldom_state`](https://github.com/Seldom-SE/seldom_state),
    which is good for state machines.


## Comparison
`bevior_tree` is not the only option for making game ai.
Also you don't have to choose only one.
Choose or combine them for your needs.
For example:
* [`seldom_state`](https://github.com/Seldom-SE/seldom_state) is implementation of state machine.
    Good for things that have rigid states, not limiting to ai.
    No good for lots of interconnected states, since it has too much transitions to add.
* [`big-brain`](https://github.com/zkat/big-brain) is implementation of utility ai.
    Utility ai select next action by their utility (expected gain).
    Perhaps you can use `ForcedSelector` kind in `bevior_tree::sequential` to do similar things.
